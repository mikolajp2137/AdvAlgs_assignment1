# shift_table and Sunday's algorithm overall:
# code at first mention of shift_table gives each letter in pattern a value, that value will be used later to determine
# how far do we need to move our pattern in relation to checked text above. I.E. ABC will have following results:
# A = 3, B = 2, C = 1.

# the best way to explain Sunday's algorithm will be with an example
# Let's say pattern is ABC and our text is FABCDE, in skip_table = {A=3,B=2,C=1}
# First we align both text and pattern to the left:
# FABCDE            and now we check matches from right to left, F and A don't match already, so now we look
# ABC               at our skip_table checking if we have there character that's the first one to the right
#                   after our pattern stopped aligning with text, in this case it's C, it exists in
# skip table, and it has a value of 1, so we move our pattern to the right by 1, it now should look like this:
# FABCDE            so now we check from left to right and A=A, B=B, C=C, great success! We have a match but
#  ABC              we need to look further if there are more matches, we look at character where strings
#                   stop aligning, and we see D, D is not in skip_table, so we use formula that in this code
# is in else statement just below, m+1 where m is of course the length of our pattern, in this case 3+1=4
# we move our pattern by 4 which would give us a placement like this:
# FABCDE            at this point our algorithm stops because i which you can think of as those empty spaces
#      ABC          on the left of pattern is obviously larger than text's length - pattern's length which
# breaks from our main while loop that goes only while <= n-m
